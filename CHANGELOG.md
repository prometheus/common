## v0.66.1 / 2025-09-05

This release has no functional changes, it just drops the dependencies `github.com/grafana/regexp` and `go.uber.org/atomic` and replaces `gopkg.in/yaml.v2` with `go.yaml.in/yaml/v2` (a drop-in replacement).

* Move to supported version of yaml parser by @dims in https://github.com/prometheus/common/pull/834
* Revert "Use go.uber.org/atomic instead of sync/atomic (#825)" by @aknuds1 in https://github.com/prometheus/common/pull/838

## v0.66.0 / 2025-09-02

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes ⚠️

* A default-constructed TextParser will be invalid. It must have a valid `scheme` set, so users should use the NewTextParser function to create a valid TextParser. Otherwise parsing will panic with "Invalid name validation scheme requested: unset".
